Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

Hello! Welcome to HW 8!

In this assignment, I will be working through 21 SQL queries! This will help improve my SQL skills and generate a Report.HTML file which will walk through each query with code and outputs included for each! 

We will be working with a remote database! Our queries will take place in the Report.QMD file in the Reports folder! This will be the only file we will be editing for this assignment!

I also updated .env with the HW8 passcode! This HW will be in preperation for our final Database assignment! My group (Group 408) will be making a database for a country club!

Thank you! I hope this HW assignment is as exciting to read as it was to create!
